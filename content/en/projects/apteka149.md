## Online store of a large network of pharmacies.

Each business nowadays **needs** its own service for keeping statistics, promoting a brand and, most importantly, for **selling products**. The chain of stores **"Pharmacy 149"** entrusted its site to us!

### A Goal

- The **visual part** of the store, compliance with the brand, identity and corporate color of the company was very important for the customer;
- A prerequisite for the project was the **automatic import** of a large catalog of goods to the site and keeping it **up to date**;
- Integration with **payment systems** to pay for orders directly on the site;
- Maintaining statistics of network sales.


### Decision

In the course of developing the design of the project, we tried to take into account all the wishes of the customer and make the resource **unique, recognizable and pleasant** to use.

In the process of developing the design, a unique interface was created that meets **modern development standards** and fully meets the wishes of the network owner.

For **automated accounting** of goods on the network, as well as convenient further integration with various services, we decided to use the **Magento 2** eCommerce platform as the basis of the project, and supplemented it with various modules developed during the work on the project.

And for the front-end and accessible to users, we used **Vue Storefront**, a flexible framework that allowed us to create the fastest possible interface. And *as a bonus*, with the help of it we managed to turn the site into **a full-fledged mobile application**.
