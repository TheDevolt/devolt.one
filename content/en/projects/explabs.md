## University Community Site Network

In 2017, the Explabs laboratory was created at the Russian Technological University MIREA (RTU MIREA). From the very beginning, Explabs was conceived as a community **that brings together students** from different departments to help them learn something new and improve their skills, and to this day, Explabs remains so.

## A goal

The main goal of the project was to create an **Business Website‎** for the promotion of Explabs in the student community. Due to the huge number of areas of work of the community, we were faced with the task of making a **unique and memorable** style for each area of ​​the center's work, while maintaining the overall **strict design**.

## Decision

Considering that Explabs belongs to a state institution, we have selected a **consistent color scheme** with bright accents in various areas of the center's work. The design of the project itself combines **light images** and **strict outlines** of beveled blocks, so that each page of the resource is **unique**, which fully corresponds to the goals set within the framework of the project.
