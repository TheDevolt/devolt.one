## Website development for an educational center

Nowadays, educational centers for preschoolers and early development centers are popular, and given the huge competition in the market, it is imperative to **stand out** among other similar institutions not only with a very high-quality education, but also with a modern approach to the work of the center, the presence of an information portal, which is essentially a **single access point** to all school resources. "Preschooler ZOON" decided to make a **high-quality and bright website** its business card. It was for such a project that they turned to us.

### A goal

The main task was to create a memorable **design** and a clear interface that would be extremely convenient for use by the key audience of the site — parents. Of course, no less urgent task was information content, a convenient **personal account** and a full-fledged resource administration system.

### Decision

As part of the work on the project, a user-friendly interface and a bright, but at the same time **not&nbsp;"eye-burning" design** was created, which will definitely attract the attention of the audience. The web service turned out to be really **high-quality and universal**, starting with information content and ending with a personal account with the possibility of authorization through the social networks VKontakte and Google.
